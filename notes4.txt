- Exercise is medicine
	- Leading a sedentary lifestyle is a common risk factor in many serious diseases including a host of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, obesity and Type 2 diabetes. 
	- Physical inactivity is a major risak factor in all cause mortality. But, it's a modifiable risk factor
	- Impaired blood vessel function, increase in adipose tissue and obesity, cardiopulmonary decline, increased risk for heart disease and diabetes and atherosclerosis.
	- To lose weight, a negative energy balance must be maintained either by reducing one's caloric intake, increasing one's daily energy expenditure through exercise or ideally, a combination of both.
	- Regular exercise can lower the risk for different forms of cancer including colon, breast and prostate cancers.
	- Regular exercise important for elderly people.
	- Exercise is good for brain. Activity in the brain is stimulated during exercise, blood flow and vascular function is enhanced.
	- Moderate exercise can significantly reduce risk factors for all cause mortality.
Diet, exercise and weight control
	- Obesity can lead to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, hypertension and liver disease. 
	- Obesity is a modifiable risk factor.
	- Measure body composition (including body fatness) using gold standard DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry)
		- assessment of total and regional body fat as well as bone density. 
		- more expensive and less accessible to public
	- Less expensive and more practical is the use of skin fold calipers in conjunction with measurement of hip and wasit circumferences.
	- Other techniques: hydrostatic or underwater weighing, bioelectrical impedance and air displacement plethysmography.
	- BMI = Weight in kg / (Height in meters) ^ 2
		- accuracy is a concern
	- Upper body fat primarily in abdominal region puts an individual at a much greater risk
		- more specifically, visceral fat located in the abdominal cavity that surrounds important organs like liver, pancreas and intestines.
	- Lower body fat carries lower risk
	- Just dieting is not sufficient. Exercise an dieting creates a negative energy balance while maintaining muscle mass.
	- Increasing total energy expenditure can reduce obesity.
- Exercise and risk factors for heart disease
	- Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease.
	- Major culprit - atherosclerosis - a disease of arteries characterized by the deposition of plaques of fatty material on their inner walls.
	- Occurs mostly in coronary arteries causing Heart Attack. But can occur in other arteries like carotid or cerbral arteries causing Stroke.
	- Major risk factors: obseity, physical inactivity, smoking, elevated blood lipids or fats, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. All are modifiable risk factors.
	- If total serum cholestrol levels are abnormally high, regular aerobic exercise has been shown to be beneficial in lowering those levels.
		- LDL - bad cholestrol - leads to plaque formation and blockage.
		- HDL - good cholestrol - helps remove LDL from the blood.
		- Exercise will lower LDL and increase HDL levels.
	- Hypertension - systolic BP > 140 and diastolic BP > 90 mm Hg.
		- Risk factors: heart failure, heart attack, stroke, kidney disease
		- Regular aerobic exercise beneficial in reducing systolic and diastolic BP in hypertensive subjects.
		- 9 month training significantly reduce BP in previously hypertensive individuals.
- Exercise and risk factors for diabetes
	- 90-95% diabetics have type 2 diabetes
	- Also known as adult onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes
	- condition characterized by chronic hyperglycemia or elevated blood glucose levels
	- No longer known as adult-onset because of increase in obesity in childhood leading to type 2 diabetes in children
	- Development of insulin resistance.
	- Type 2 diabetes related to obesity
		- increase in visceral fat in the abdominal region around organs can lead to insulin resistance and thus type 2 diabetes
	- Symptoms: thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, slow-healing sores and frequent infections and blurred vision.
	- Complications
		- 5-30 fold increases risk of retinopathy with eventual blindness
		- nephropathy or kidney disease
		- neuropathy or diabetic nerve pain
		- lower limb amputations
		- added risk of coronary heart disease and stroke
	- Modifiable risk factors: physical inactivity, obesity, hypertension and elevated cholestrol levels.
	- Oral glucose tolerance test - after fasting overnight the individual consumes a glucose drink and the rate in which glucose is cleared from the blood is measured over time.
		- non-diabetic individual: 90 mins to clear glucose
		- diabetic individual: significantly longer
	- Regular exercise helps in two ways
		- Single bout of exercise can significantly reduce glucose levels in the diabetic
		- Increase insulin sensitivity in the muscle thereby decreasing insulin resistance
- Exercise and risk factors for cancer
	- Cancer - group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.
	- Over 200 different forms of cancer.
	- Major modifiable risk factors pertaining to cancer prevention include obesity, physical inactivity and poor dietary habits.
	- Regular exercise has shown to lower risk factors for three of four major forms of cancer which are breast, prostate and colon. (Fourth one is Lung).
	- Ways
		- retards cancer growth at certain sites by enhancing natural immunity
		- increase level of antioxidants - reduces damaging effects from cellular oxidative stress known to promote cancer
		- lowers body fat - risk factor in various types of cancer like breast cancer
		- reduces certain growth factors that can contribute to tumor growth such as IGF-1 (insulin like growth factor 1)
	- The more aerobically fit an individual is, the less likely they will die from a cancer related illness.
	- Physical activity has been shown to reduce severity of the side effects of cancer treatment in patients.
	- May also lessen the chances of recurrence and mortality for certain types of cancer.
	- Include exercise for cancer-related fatigue.
- Exercise and successful aging
	- Aging is a non-modifiable risk factor
	- Stamina, strength, balance and flexibility can be offset by participation in a sound program of regular exercise.
	- Never too late to begin aerobic exercise.
	- Sarcopenia - loss of skeletal muscle mass at a function with advancing age
		- after 50 years of age, 10% reduction in muscle mass per decade is possible
		- loss in muscle strength, decline in bone mineral density, inability to maintain balance during movement thus increasing risk of falling, risk of fractures, negatively impacts V02max and endurance
	- Osteoporosis
		- porous bones
		- decrease in bone density due to calcium imbalance
		- results in brittle bones that are easily fractured
		- Modifiable risk factors - physical inacitivity, low calcium and vitamin D levels, smoking
	- Important to incorporate weight lifting in exercise routine targeting upper body as they receive little benefit from aerobic activities.
- Exercise and your brain
	- Brain is active during exercise
		- enhanced neuroelectrical activity
		- increased brain blood flow
	- Implications of exercise on the brain
		- helps maintain or improve cognitive function
		- reduce age related dementia - including Alzheimer's disease
		- treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease
		- lessen severity of depression and anxiety
		- reduce the negative effects of chronic stress
	- Pillars of a healthy brain
		- regular exercise
		- healthy diet
		- mental stimulation
		- stess management
		- sleep quality
		- active social life
		- Exercise has potential to influence all these factors
	- Vascular degeneration is common cause for dementia and eventual Alzheimer's disease
	- Dementia - loss of mental function in two or more areas such as langauge, visual and spatial abilities, memory, thinking and reasoning or judgement.
	- Alzheimer's 
		- denerative disease that attacks the brain gradually over time
		- modifiable risk factors - regular exercise, hypertension, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, etc.
	- Exercise can
		- reduce several of other modifiable risk factors
		- reduce negative effects of chronic stess
		- maintain brain blood flow and increase glucagon-like peptide 1 both of which can reduce accumulation of beta amyloid plaques synonymous with Alzheimer's disease
	- Parkinson's
		- a neurodegenerative brain disorder that progresses slowly in most patients
		- brain slowly stops producing neurotransmitter, dopamine
		- as a result, a person has less ability to regulate their muscle movements and body coordination
		- Symptoms: slowness of movement, involuntary shaking or tremors at test, stiffness of arms, legs or trunk
		- difficulty of balance, frequency of falls
		- Exercise reduces the symptoms of the disease
			- strenghten and improve motor circuitry
			- increased expression of neurotropic factors, increased blood flow and neurogenesis (formation of new brain neurons)
	- Depression
		- Symptoms: depressed mood, feelings of sadness, fatigue, sleep disruption, changes in appetite and body weight, reduced interest in life events, hopelessness and suicide
		- Risk factors: female gender, physical inactivity, family history, stress, social isolation and chronic health condition
		- Greater involvement of regular exercise, the less is the risk of clinical depression.
