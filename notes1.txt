Principles in exercise physiology:
1. Homeostasis:
	- tendency of the body to maintain a stable internal environment for cells by narrowly regulating critical variables like pH or acid base balance, oxygen tension, blood glucose concentration, body temperature, etc.
	- Any deviation from optimal adjustments makes the body to make adjustments so as to bring them back to normal.
	- engaging in physical exercise is a disruptor of normal resting homeostasis
2. Overload:
	- if you habitually overload a system, it will respond and adapt.
	- stress due to exercise makes the body to give an acute response and continuing to exercise the similar way for 3-5 times a week leads to chronic adaptation of stress caused due to regular exercise.
3. Specificity:
	- only the system or body part stressed will adapt.
4. Reversibility:
	- Whereas overloading will result in training adaptations, inactivity (or detraining) will result in a return to baseline.
5. Individuality:
	- While the physiological responses to a particular stimulus are largely predictable, the precise responses and adaptations will vary among individuals.

Calorimetry:
- measurement of heat production in calories
- estimate individual's metabolic rate by estimating the rate of heat production
- type of calorimetry:
	- direct - make individual exercise in a chamber and monitor the heat released by his body using thermal sensing devices. But these chambers are very expensive for clinicians, researchers, etc.
	- indirect - most common method. Specifically by measuring oxygen consumption.
	- indirect method also allows to measure the amount of CO2 produced by the body.
	- this value along with O2 consumption value allows us to calculate the respiratory exchange ratio (RER):
		RER = VCO2 / VO2
	- RER gives information about the type of fuel or substrate being used by the muscles during exercise

Adrenosine Triophosphate (ATP):
- the muscles' source of energy
- breaking down of this molecule leads to release of large amount of energy to the cells so as to enable muscle contraction
- only ATP can be directly used to supply energy needed for mechanical work of exercise
- ATP levels need to be maintained during exercise
- at rest, concentration of ATP in muscles is extremely low
- key enzymes int ATP-producing pathways are activated during exercise. This is controlled by change in energy charge of cell.
- Energy charge = ([ATP] + 0.5 * [ADP]) / ([ATP] + [AMP] + [ADP])
- As energy charge decreases, the ATP generating pathways are activated.
- mitochondira are responsible for ATP production both at rest and during exercise
- ATP production pathways must be activated when we go from rest to exercise to match the ATP production with that of utilization
- two types of activities:
	- aerobic - which require ATP production and utilization both. Like those exercises which lasts for more than 10 minutes
	- anaerobic - which immediately requires ATP and doesn't have time to wait for oxidation of macro-nutrients. Like fast exercises which lasts for several seconds.
- immediate energy sources:
	- ATP + H2O -> ADP (ATPase) + Pi
	- CP (creatine kinase) + ADP -> ATP + C
- Carbohydrate is the only macro nutrient that can be broken down aerobically and anaerobically (via glycolysis) to supply ATP
- For aerobic activities, ATP comes from breakdown of carbohydrates and fats

Carbohydrates:
- stored majorly in muscles and liver
- stored as glycogen which is series of glucose molecules attached to one another
- muscle glycogen is used to supply glucose units for muscle energetics
- liver glycogen is used to maintain blood glucose levels and this is critical as during exercise, muscle extracts glucose from the blood for fuel.
- on average in body (avg. 154 pounds individual) there is about 2 kcal of carbohydrates (this is very less amount, not sufficient for prolonged exercise). In contrast to this fats on average is about 100000 kcal.
- in aerobic activities, the key is to use fats as fuel to greater extent.
- as amount of time for exercise increases, the preferred fuel shifts from fats to carbohydrates (this is called crossover) since, the fat amount is being consumed and is declining.
- The activation of key enzymes in the pathways of glycogenolysis and glycolysis are regulated by multiple factors including hormones, intramuscular calcium levels, and the energy charge in working muscles.
- Type 1 muscles fibres are recruited for submaximal steady-state exercise
- Type 2 muscles fibres are recruited when great force and power are required
- For intense exercise, blood glucose uptake increases rapidly and as long as glycogen stores hold down, liver does a remarkable job of maintaining blood glucose levels .preventing exercise induced hypoglycemia.
- Breakdown of liver glycogen is regulated by pancreatic hormone, glucogon. Whereas breakdown of muscle glycogen is regulated by hormone, epinephirne.
- To offset carbohydrate depletion:
	- first, store glycogen (carbohydrates) prior exercise so as to avoid glycogen depletion and set fatigue.
	- carbohydrate feeding - driking dilute carbohydrate liquids during exercise can help maintain blood glucose levels thereby sparing liver glycogen.
- Lower RER clearly indicates that fats are being used to a greater extent after training.
- Endurance training increases the number of mitochondria which in turns contributes to greater use of fats and burn carbohydrates aerobically. Both of these lead to carbohydrate sparing.

Fats:
- two types:
	- Free Fatty Acids (FFA) - serve as immediate fuel source for cells. Produce ATP in mitrochondria via oxidation.
	- Triglycerides or triacylglycerols - major storage form of fat (FFA) and thus a major source of fuel. Located in adipose tissue and muscle. FFAs are stored collectively in the form of triglycerides (similar to glucose in glycogen)
- primary storage for triglycerides - adipose or fat cells and in skeletal muscles.
- largest amount of triglycerides stored in adipose (100000 kcal)
- second largest amount of triglycerides stored in skeletal muscles (2700 kcal) (also known as intramuscular triglycerides)

Proteins:
- small role but the main contribution comes after an exercise bout.
- made up of amino acids
- Essential amino acids cannot be made by the body - must come from dietary sources.
- Non-essential amino acids can be synthesized within the body - so no dietary sources required.
- To use proteins as fuel, they must be broken down to amino acids form. Amino acids can be converted to carbohydrates / fats.
- Nitrogen balance - to measure the individuals dietary protein needs and their general whole body protein mechanism.
- If input N2 is equal to excreted N2, then individual is said to have nitrogen balance and no changes in dietary protien intake to be made.
- Protien requirements will be high during intense endurance training and heavy strength training.
- During aerobic exercise, protein synthesis decreases but after exercises it rapidly increases.
- When carbohydrates are low, their will be greater dependence on proteins for fuel. Proteins can supply 5-15% of fuel during exercise.
